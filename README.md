# School District Analysis
## Project Overview
In this challenge, I re-performed the school district analysis, considering the evidence of academic dishonesty at Thomas High School that jeopardized ninth-grade students' test scores. I was instructed to replace the ninth-grade math and reading scores with "NaN" while keeping the rest of the data intact. In the following section, we'll discuss how these changes affected the overall analysis.
## Results:
#### School District Summary 
  * The score replacement impacted the average math score by 0.1 points, while the average reading score stayed unchanged.
  * Passing math and reading percentages dropped by 0.2%  and 0.1%, respectively
  * The overall passing rate has decreased by 0.3% after the alteration
  * The remaining key metrics were unaffected since their calculation did not include NaN values.
